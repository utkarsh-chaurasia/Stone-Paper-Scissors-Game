# INTRODUCTION
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a hand game most often played by children. It is often used as a selection method in a similar way to coin flipping, Odd or Even, throwing dice or drawing straws to randomly select a person for some purpose, though unlike truly random selections it can be played with skill if the game extends over many sessions, because one can often recognize and exploit the non-random behavior of an opponent.

It is also known by many other names such as Rochambeau, Paper Scissors Stone/Rock (UK), Paper Scissors Rock (NZ), Ching Chong Cha (South Africa) , Jiandao Sh√≠tou Bu (China), Janken (Japan), Schnick, Schnack, Schnuck (German) and Piedra, papel o tijera (Spanish).

Various sports may use Stone, Paper, Scissors to determine which team gets the opening play (rather than a coin toss). Similarly, uncertain calls, or even the whole game in case of rain, may be decided by the game. It is also often used as a method for creating appropriately non-biased random results in live action role-playing games, as it requires no equipment. It is also used in some gambling sites as a novelty betting.

The game is highly useful in resolving trivial disputes amongst children. If a parent or caregiver suggests a game of Stone Paper Scissors, both children will usually spontaneously agree to it, as it appeals to their competitive streaks. After a winner is found, the loser may attempt to resume the argument (claiming to not care about the RPS game, and that they are in the right regardless of its outcome), but will usually accept the response by both the caregiver and the other child that "you agreed to Stone Paper Scissors and you lost, so accept it". Additionally, if a child refuses to enter into a RPS battle to resolve a dispute, it can be an indication to the caregiver that their concern is of a more serious nature.
